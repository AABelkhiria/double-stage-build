# Multi Stage Docker Build

This repository demonstrates how to efficiently build and run containerized applications using multi-stage Dockerfiles. Multi-stage builds help reduce image size and improve security by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.

## Repo Structure

This repository contains the following directories:
- `docker`: Contains a Dockerfile demonstrating best practices for building lightweight, secure containers.
- `examples`: An example application written in Go, illustrating the multi-stage build process. It includes a dedicated README with setup instructions.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Stage Dockerfile**: Optimize your container size by building the application in one stage and packaging it in a minimal runtime image.
- **Customizable Base Images**: Start with any base image suitable for your project's needs.
- **Dependency Management**: Efficiently cache and manage dependencies for faster builds.
- **Security and Performance**: Separate the build environment from the runtime environment for enhanced security and performance.

## Example: Go Application

This repository includes a Go application example showcasing how to use multi-stage builds. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Go Example README](./example/README.md).

## Best Practices

When working with multi-stage Dockerfiles, consider the following best practices:

- **Cache Dependencies**: Copy dependencies separately to leverage Docker's caching mechanism.
- **Minimal Final Image**: Use a minimal base image (e.g., `alpine`) for the final stage to reduce attack surface and improve performance.
- **Expose Only Necessary Ports**: Limit exposed ports to what's required for your application.

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Failures**: Ensure all dependencies are specified and accessible.
- **Container Start Issues**: Confirm the entry point is correct and all necessary environment variables are set.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Use minimal base images and optimize application dependencies.
